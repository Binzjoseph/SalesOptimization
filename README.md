# Walmart Sales Optimization Project

This repository contains all materials related to our project on optimizing Walmart's sales performance through a comprehensive analysis of sales data and 
strategic decision-making methodologies.

## Project Overview
In this project, we explored Walmart's sales data from 2010 to 2012 obtained from Kaggle, to forecast future sales and identify strategic opportunities for sales optimization 
across its various stores. Our approach combined time series forecasting, regression analysis, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to derive actionable insights.

## Repository Contents
- **Company Case Report.pdf**: The detailed project report that outlines our methodology, analysis, findings, and recommendations for Walmart's sales optimization.
- **Company_Business_Case_ppt.pptx**: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project's key points, designed for stakeholder briefings and academic presentations.
- **Dashboard.xlsx**: An Excel dashboard that visually represents Walmart's sales data, trends, and insights derived from our analysis.
- **Sales_Optimization_using_AHP_process.xlsx**: An Excel workbook detailing the application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to prioritize strategic initiatives
- based on a comprehensive set of criteria and alternatives.

## Key Insights
Our analysis highlighted the potential for sales improvement by focusing on specific zones, leveraging holiday sales opportunities, 
and addressing factors that significantly impact sales performance, such as temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rates.
